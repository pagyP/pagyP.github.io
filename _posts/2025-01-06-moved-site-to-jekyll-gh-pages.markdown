- After a bit of a mistake with my previous Hugo setup on GH pages, I've moved to Jekyll and GH pages.
- Got some tidying up to to do with the images on the posts, but I'll get to that over the next few days.
- Need to play with some jekyll themes and see if I can find one I like.
- Republish posts from the old site.
